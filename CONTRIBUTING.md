# Contributing to the Vignette wiki

Want to contribute to the Vignette wiki? Great!

Before that, keep in mind a couple of points.

1. We use [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) as our <insert word here i am stupid and cant think of anything>

2. All the pages should be neutral, and use second person to refer to the user where possible.

3. <something>



## Markdown styling

We are very strict about styling, to keep the wiki as consistent as possible.

- Use `-` to create bullet lists
  
  ```md
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
  ...
  ```

- Use `.` to create ordered lists

- ```md
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3
  ...
  ```
