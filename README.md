# The Vignette Wiki

the official documentation repository for Vignette, powered by Docusaurus. This serves as our official web-based guide for everything and anything about Vignette.

## Looking for a PDF version?

While we won't be able to provide a PDF version of it (yet), we will commit to releasing a PDF once every major release.

## Building and Contributing

Make sure you read our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/vignetteapp/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Once done, you may start to work on the documentation 
by having a live copy of the website in your machine with Node.js installed. Once done, you may start to view your changes using:

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn serve
```
