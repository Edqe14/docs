# Prerequisites

Before you install, Vignette mandates some minimum and recommended system requirements. These are set requirements to make sure you have the optimal experience
regardless of configuration.

## Minimum Requirements

At best, Vignette requires the following:

### Windows

- At least a quad-core CPU.
- 2-4GB of memory.
- 2GB free disk space, with either an SSD or a fast HDD.

### Linux

- A modern kernel (4.12+). Older kernels may work but are not supported and will not be tested against.
- At least a quad-core CPU.
- 2-4GB of memory.
- 2GB free disk space, with either an SSD or a fast HDD.
- You have the V4L2 libraries installed and `libasound2-dev` installed.

These are the minimum requirements to get an optimal experience to run *just Vignette*. This does not account for other programs and other workloads.

## Recommended requirements

If you are a streamer, or a system integrator looking into using Vignette into your own workflow or agency, we recommend the following specifications to run
Vignette. These requirements account for common streaming workflows and CPU/GPU intensive workloads combined with Vignette:

- An Octa-Core CPU.
- At least 8-16GB of memory.
- 2-4 GB of free disk space, we recommend a NVMe SSD.
- A modern operating system, preferrably Windows 11 or Linux with the latest kernel (5.x).


If you meet all these requirements, you can proceed to the [Installation Methods](install-methods.md).
